# Compiler-Construction
A mini compiler in j--, a derivation language of Java.

After this project in my Compiler Construction class, I will never take compilers for granted again. From the minimal given identifiers, operations,
more were added to make j-- a more powerful compiler, closer to it ascendant Java compiler.
